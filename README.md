# Dobot-maze-solver-using-agnetic-ai
This project integrates computer vision, pathfinding AI, and robotic control to autonomously navigate and draw paths through a physical maze. Using a camera and the Dobot robotic arm, the system acts as an intelligent agent that perceives, plans, and acts—executing end-to-end maze solving with no human intervention beyond setup.
